  acceptance criteria that helped me build this application:

  GIVEN a note-taking application
  WHEN I open the Note Taker
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the       note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save button
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the            navigation disappear
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
  WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
  THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
